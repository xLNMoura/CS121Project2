# CS121Projects

In this project, I had to download, extract, and open the project code in jGrasp. Then, make some
modifications to the code, compile and run the program. I am able to see if the program works by
examining the output that is printed to the console. There are five modifications that I needed to
make in the code. Each modification is specified by the comments in the source code file.
After I made all five modifications as specified by the comments, I created a zip
file and then uploaded it to Gradescope. Gradescope will run an autograder on my code and
report my score. 
The project files seen when I extract the project code are:

Project1.java
Project1.gpj

The first file is a Java source code file where I made my modifications. The second file
is a jGrasp project file. No need to modify this file.
The rest of this document describes the steps I needed to take for a successful project
outcome
